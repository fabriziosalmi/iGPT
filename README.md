# InverseGPT

Welcome to InverseGPT, a novel application designed to work inversely with the GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) models, generating something fun from given questions or inputs.

## Overview

InverseGPT takes the concept of generative AI and flips it, focusing on deducing the input one message before that could have led to a given output. This can be especially useful for creating educational content, data analysis, and improving human-AI interaction.
